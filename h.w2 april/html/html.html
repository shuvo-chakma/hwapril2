        <h2>Facbook</h2>
        <p>Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[15] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.</p>

 <p>In mid-2004, Napster co-founder and entrepreneur Sean Parker—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became company president.[31] In June 2004, the company moved to Palo Alto, California.[32] Sean Parker called Reid Hoffman to fund Facebook. However, Reid Hoffman was too busy launching LinkedIn so he set Facebook up with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who gave Facebook its first investment later that month.[33][34] In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com for US$200,000 ($312,012 in 2023 dollars[20]).[35] The domain had belonged to AboutFace Corporation</p>
